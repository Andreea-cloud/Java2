**Description**
--------

This application simulates the delivery process of orders plased by various clients - a minimalist version of a delivery sistem as a FanCourier. 

I identified three entities (client, courier and order), with the following relationships between them:
 - a courier can deliver several orders;
 - an order can be delivered by a single courier;
 - a client can have several addresses;
 - a client can place several orders;

**I used:**
- RMI;
- JPA;
- MVC;
- CRUD operations;

**Tools used:**
- XAMPP
- InteliJ Idea as IDE
